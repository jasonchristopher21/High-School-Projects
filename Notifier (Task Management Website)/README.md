## Project name: Notifier

Description:
Notifier is a task management website prototype I made in Year 11. 
The website utilises HTML, CSS and basic Javascript. 

To use:
1. First open the file login.html
2. login.html uses a script that enables a specific username and password to access the website. Currently the username and password is set to the following:

- Username: **test**
- Password: **123**

3. Upon entering the correct username and password, you will be redirected to file dashboard.html
4. errorfile.html is a filler page for sections that will be of further development.
